## Description:

---

In this challenge I had to refactor the code. What this means is that i had to restructure the code to meet accessibility standards and acceptance criteria. Doing this helped me better understand the Agile project management that is commonly seen/used by tech companys. This exersize mimics a 'On-the-job' ticket or 'feature request Challenges.'

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Mock Up

![The Horisean we page mock up that includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page](./images/Screenshot%20(118).png)

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
